# DSAify

## What is DSAify?

DSAify is a unique, terminal-based command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help you master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through active practice. Unlike traditional platforms that focus solely on writing code from scratch, DSAify provides a hands-on, interactive experience where you practice typing out the solutions to common DSA problems.

## How it Works for the End User

DSAify guides you through a series of DSA problems. For each problem, you'll be presented with the problem statement and then challenged to type out the solution code. The CLI provides real-time feedback, helping you identify errors and improve your typing speed and accuracy for common DSA patterns.

The core idea is to build muscle memory and familiarity with the syntax and structure of various algorithms and data structures. By repeatedly typing out solutions, you'll not only reinforce your understanding of the concepts but also significantly increase your coding speed and reduce common typing mistakes.

## Why I Created This Project

As a developer, I was constantly searching for an effective way to practice DSA. Many existing platforms are excellent for problem-solving, but I found a gap in tools that focused on the _physical act_ of coding and building speed. I realized that while understanding an algorithm is crucial, the ability to quickly and accurately translate that understanding into working code is equally important, especially in timed coding challenges or when rapidly prototyping.

DSAify was born out of this personal need. It's a tool I built for myself to:

- **Increase Typing Speed:** Specifically for DSA-related code.
- **Build Muscle Memory:** For common algorithmic patterns and data structure implementations.
- **Improve Accuracy:** Reduce syntax errors and typos during rapid coding.
- **Reinforce Learning:** Active recall through typing helps solidify theoretical knowledge.

This terminal-based CLI approach perfectly fits my development setup, allowing for a seamless and focused practice environment without context switching.

## Installation

You can get DSAify in two ways. Use `npx` for a quick run. Or, install it directly from GitHub.

### Run with `npx`

Want to try it fast? Use `npx`. It runs DSAify without installing it globally.

```bash
npx github:iamharshdabas/dsaify
```

This command fetches and runs the latest version from GitHub.

### Install from GitHub

Prefer to install it? Get it straight from the GitHub repository.

```bash
npm i -g github:iamharshdabas/dsaify
```

After installing, you can run DSAify like this:

```bash
dsaify
```
