A* Search is a pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm. Its purpose is to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost from the current node to the goal, combining it with the actual cost from the start node to the current node. It explores nodes that are likely to be on the shortest path first. It is optimal (finds the shortest path) and complete (finds a path if one exists) when the heuristic is admissible and consistent. It is more efficient than Dijkstra's for single-source shortest path problems with a good heuristic. Common use cases include game AI (pathfinding for characters), robotics (navigation), network routing, and logistics.
