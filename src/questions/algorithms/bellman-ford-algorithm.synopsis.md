Bellman-Ford Algorithm is a single-source shortest path algorithm. Its purpose is to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted digraph, even if some edge weights are negative. It works by repeatedly relaxing edges, gradually reducing the estimated shortest path distance until no more improvements can be made. A key characteristic is its ability to detect negative cycles, which Dijkstra's algorithm cannot. It is often used in network routing protocols (like RIP) where edge weights might represent costs or delays that could be negative.
