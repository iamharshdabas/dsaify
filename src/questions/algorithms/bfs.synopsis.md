Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm. Its purpose is to explore all the vertices of a graph or tree in a breadthward motion, visiting all the nodes at the current depth level before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. It works by using a queue to keep track of the next vertex to visit. BFS is guaranteed to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Common use cases include finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, network broadcasting, and web crawlers.
