Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until the item is found or the possibilities are exhausted. Its key advantage is its logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)), making it significantly faster than linear search for large datasets. Common use cases include searching in databases, finding elements in sorted arrays, and implementing lookup functions.
