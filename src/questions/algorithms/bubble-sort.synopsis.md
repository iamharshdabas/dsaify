Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm. Its purpose is to arrange elements in an array in a specific order (ascending or descending). It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. While easy to understand, its quadratic time complexity (O(n^2)) makes it inefficient for large datasets. It is primarily used for educational purposes or for very small datasets.
