The Coin Change Problem is a classic dynamic programming problem. Its purpose is to find the minimum number of coins (or the total number of ways) required to make a given amount, given a set of coin denominations. It works by building up a solution from smaller subproblems, typically using a 1D or 2D array to store intermediate results. This approach avoids redundant calculations and ensures optimality. It is a fundamental problem for understanding dynamic programming and is often encountered in technical interviews. Common use cases include currency exchange, vending machine logic, and resource allocation problems.
