  synopsis:
    "Depth-First Search (DFS)\n\nWhat is Depth-First Search (DFS)?\n\nDepth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It starts at a specified source vertex and explores as deeply as possible along each path before returning to explore other branches. This process continues until all reachable vertices have been visited.\n\nHow it Works:\n\nDFS typically uses a stack data structure (either explicitly or implicitly through recursion) to manage the order of vertices to be visited. The general steps are as follows:\n\n1.  **Initialization:**\n    *   Create a set or array to keep track of visited vertices to avoid cycles and redundant processing. Mark the starting vertex as visited.\n    *   Create a list to store the order of visited vertices (the result of the DFS).\n    *   (Implicitly or explicitly) Push the starting vertex onto a stack.\n\n2.  **Traversal (Recursive Approach - most common):**\n    *   Define a recursive helper function `dfsRecursive(currentNode)`:\n        *   Mark `currentNode` as visited.\n        *   Add `currentNode` to the result list.\n        *   For each unvisited neighbor of `currentNode`:\n            *   Recursively call `dfsRecursive(neighbor)`.\n\n3.  **Traversal (Iterative Approach - using an explicit stack):**\n    *   Push the starting vertex onto a stack.\n    *   While the stack is not empty:\n        *   Pop a vertex from the top of the stack. This is the `current` vertex.\n        *   If `current` has not been visited:\n            *   Mark `current` as visited.\n            *   Add `current` to the result list.\n            *   For each unvisited neighbor of `current` (often pushed in reverse order to maintain desired traversal order):\n                *   Push the neighbor onto the stack.\n\n4.  **Termination:** The algorithm terminates when all reachable vertices have been visited and the stack (or recursion call stack) is empty.\n\nKey Characteristics:\n\n*   **Depth-First Exploration:** DFS explores as deeply as possible along each path before backtracking.\n*   **Data Structure:** It primarily uses a stack (LIFO - Last-In, First-Out) to manage the order of exploration. Recursion implicitly uses the call stack.\n*   **Applications:** DFS is suitable for problems that involve searching through a tree or graph structure where the order of visiting nodes doesn't matter as much as exploring all paths, such as topological sorting, cycle detection, and finding connected components.\n\nHow to Implement it (Conceptual Steps - Recursive):\n\n1.  **Function Signature:** Define a function `dfs(graph, startNode)` that takes the graph (e.g., an adjacency list) and the starting node as input.\n2.  **Visited Set:** Initialize an empty `Set` called `visited`.\n3.  **Result Array:** Initialize an empty array `result`.\n4.  **Recursive Helper:** Define an inner recursive function `dfsRecursive(currentNode)`:\n    *   Add `currentNode` to `visited`.\n    *   Add `currentNode` to `result`.\n    *   Get neighbors of `currentNode` from `graph`.\n    *   For each `neighbor`, if not in `visited`, call `dfsRecursive(neighbor)`.\n5.  **Initial Call:** Call `dfsRecursive(startNode)`.\n6.  **Return Result:** Return the `result` array.\n\nHints:\n\n*   **Graph Representation:** Similar to BFS, DFS can be applied to graphs represented using adjacency lists or adjacency matrices. The provided solution uses a `Map` for an adjacency list.\n*   **Avoiding Cycles:** The `visited` set is essential to prevent infinite loops in graphs with cycles.\n*   **Applications:** DFS is used in various algorithms and applications, including:\n    *   Topological sorting (for Directed Acyclic Graphs - DAGs).\n    *   Finding connected components in a graph.\n    *   Cycle detection in graphs.\n    *   Solving puzzles with a single solution (e.g., mazes, sudoku).\n    *   Pathfinding (though BFS is often preferred for shortest paths in unweighted graphs).",
