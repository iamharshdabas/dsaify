Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack data structure (implicitly through recursion or explicitly with an array) to keep track of the nodes to visit. DFS is commonly used for topological sorting, finding connected components, cycle detection in graphs, and solving puzzles with a single solution (e.g., mazes).
