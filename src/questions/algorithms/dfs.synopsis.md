Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm. Its purpose is to explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It works by using a stack (implicitly or explicitly) to keep track of the vertices to visit. DFS is often used for finding paths, cycles, and connected components in a graph. Common use cases include topological sorting, solving mazes, and detecting cycles in a graph.
