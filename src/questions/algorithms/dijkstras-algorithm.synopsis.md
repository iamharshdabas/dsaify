Dijkstra's Algorithm is a single-source shortest path algorithm. Its purpose is to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights. It works by iteratively selecting the unvisited vertex with the smallest known distance from the source and updating the distances of its neighbors. It is optimal for graphs with non-negative edge weights. Common use cases include network routing (e.g., OSPF), GPS navigation systems, and finding shortest paths in various real-world scenarios.
