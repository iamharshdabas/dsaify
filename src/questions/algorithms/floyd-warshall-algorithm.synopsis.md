Floyd-Warshall Algorithm is an all-pairs shortest path algorithm. Its purpose is to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph, which can have positive or negative edge weights (but no negative cycles). It works by iteratively considering all possible intermediate vertices between every pair of source and destination vertices. Its key characteristic is its simplicity and ability to handle negative edge weights. Common use cases include finding transitive closure of relations, analyzing network connectivity, and in various graph-related problems where all-pairs shortest paths are required.
