Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm. Its purpose is to build a final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It works by taking elements from the input data and inserting them into their correct position in a new sorted list. It is efficient for small data sets and is generally more efficient than other simple quadratic algorithms like Bubble Sort or Selection Sort. Common use cases include sorting a small number of elements or when the input array is nearly sorted.
