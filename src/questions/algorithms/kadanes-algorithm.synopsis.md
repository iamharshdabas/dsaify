Kadane's Algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm. Its purpose is to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers. It works by iterating through the array and keeping track of two values: the maximum sum ending at the current position, and the overall maximum sum found so far. Its key advantage is its linear time complexity (O(n)), making it highly efficient for large arrays. Common use cases include financial analysis (finding periods of maximum profit), image processing, and other optimization problems where a contiguous segment with the largest sum is needed.
