KMP Search Algorithm (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) is a string-searching algorithm. Its purpose is to find occurrences of a 'pattern' word within a main 'text' string with optimal efficiency. It works by preprocessing the pattern to build a 'longest proper prefix suffix' (LPS) array, which helps to avoid re-checking characters that have already been matched, thus skipping comparisons. This optimization gives it a linear time complexity (O(n+m), where n is text length and m is pattern length). Common use cases include text editors (find/replace functionality), bioinformatics (DNA sequence matching), and plagiarism detection.
