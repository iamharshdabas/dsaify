The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem. Its purpose is to select a subset of items, each with a weight and a value, to maximize the total value within a given weight capacity of a knapsack. It is a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization and often solved using dynamic programming. The 0/1 Knapsack variant (where items cannot be broken) is typically solved by building a DP table that stores the maximum value for each weight capacity and subset of items. Common use cases include resource allocation, cutting stock problems, and financial portfolio optimization.
