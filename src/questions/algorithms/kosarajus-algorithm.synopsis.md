Kosaraju's Algorithm is an algorithm used to find the strongly connected components (SCCs) of a directed graph. Its purpose is to decompose a directed graph into its SCCs, which are maximal subgraphs where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex within that subgraph. It works in two main phases: first, a depth-first search (DFS) is performed on the original graph to compute finishing times for all vertices; second, a DFS is performed on the transpose of the graph, processing vertices in decreasing order of their finishing times from the first DFS. This algorithm is relatively straightforward to implement and has a time complexity of O(V+E). Common use cases include analyzing dependencies in software modules, network analysis, and solving 2-satisfiability problems.
