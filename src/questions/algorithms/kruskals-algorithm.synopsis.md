Kruskal's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for a connected, undirected graph. Its purpose is to find a subset of the edges that forms a tree, includes every vertex, and has the minimum possible total edge weight. It works by sorting all the edges in the graph in non-decreasing order of their weights, and then iteratively adding the smallest-weight edge that does not form a cycle with the already added edges. A Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure is typically used to efficiently detect cycles. It is often preferred for its simplicity and efficiency on sparse graphs. Common use cases include network design (e.g., laying out telecommunication or transportation networks), cluster analysis, and image segmentation.
