Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) is a classic problem in computer science. Its purpose is to find the longest subsequence common to two or more sequences. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. It is typically solved using dynamic programming, building a table that stores the lengths of LCS for all prefixes of the two sequences. Common use cases include bioinformatics (comparing DNA sequences), diff utilities (showing differences between files), and plagiarism detection.
