Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) is a classic dynamic programming problem. Its purpose is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. It can be solved using dynamic programming in O(n^2) time, or more efficiently in O(n log n) time using patience sorting principles. Common use cases include bioinformatics, data analysis, and optimizing certain types of resource allocation.
