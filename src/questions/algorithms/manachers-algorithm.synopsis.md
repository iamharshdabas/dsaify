Manacher's Algorithm is a linear-time algorithm for finding the longest palindromic substring in a string. Its purpose is to efficiently identify the longest substring that reads the same forwards and backwards. It works by transforming the input string to handle even and odd length palindromes uniformly, and then expanding around centers while leveraging previously computed palindrome lengths to avoid redundant checks. Its key advantage is its O(n) time complexity, which is optimal. Common use cases include text processing, bioinformatics, and string matching problems.
