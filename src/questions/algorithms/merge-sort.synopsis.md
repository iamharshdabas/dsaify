Merge Sort is an efficient, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm. It works by dividing an unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted). Then, it repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sorted sublist remaining. Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases, making it a stable and reliable sorting algorithm.
