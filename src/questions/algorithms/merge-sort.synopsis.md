Merge Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Its purpose is to efficiently sort a list or array of elements. It works on the principle of 'divide and conquer': it divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted), and then repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sorted list remaining. Its key advantage is its guaranteed O(n log n) time complexity, making it efficient for large datasets and stable (preserves the relative order of equal elements). Common use cases include external sorting, parallel sorting, and as a subroutine in other algorithms like counting inversions.
