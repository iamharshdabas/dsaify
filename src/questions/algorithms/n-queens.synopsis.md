The N-Queens Problem is a classic combinatorial problem. Its purpose is to place N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. A queen can attack horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The problem is typically solved using a backtracking algorithm, which systematically tries to place queens one by one in each row, checking for conflicts with previously placed queens. If a conflict is found, it backtracks and tries a different position. It is a good example of how to use recursion and backtracking to solve constraint satisfaction problems. Common use cases include demonstrating backtracking, and as a simplified model for resource allocation or scheduling problems with constraints.
