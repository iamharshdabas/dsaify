Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for a connected, undirected graph. Its purpose is to find a subset of the edges that forms a tree, includes every vertex, and has the minimum possible total edge weight. It works by starting from an arbitrary vertex and iteratively adding the cheapest edge that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST, until all vertices are included. It is often preferred for dense graphs. Common use cases include network design (e.g., connecting a set of computers with the least amount of cable), cluster analysis, and circuit design.
