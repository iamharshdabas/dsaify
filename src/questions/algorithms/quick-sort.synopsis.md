Quick Sort is an efficient, in-place, comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. Quick sort has an average time complexity of O(n log n), but in the worst case, it can be O(n^2).
