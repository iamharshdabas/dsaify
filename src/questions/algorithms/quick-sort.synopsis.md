Quick Sort is an efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Its purpose is to arrange elements in an array in a specific order (ascending or descending). It works on the principle of 'divide and conquer': it picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted. Its key advantages include its average-case time complexity of O(n log n) and its in-place sorting nature (minimal extra space required). Common use cases include general-purpose sorting in various applications, database systems, and as a component in other algorithms.
