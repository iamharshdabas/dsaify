Rabin-Karp Algorithm is a string-searching algorithm. Its purpose is to find occurrences of a pattern string within a larger text string. It works by computing a hash value for the pattern and for each window of the text of the same length as the pattern. If the hash values match, it then performs a character-by-character comparison to confirm the match, minimizing spurious hits. Its key advantage is its average-case linear time complexity (O(n+m)), making it efficient for multiple pattern searches. Common use cases include plagiarism detection, searching for DNA sequences, and network intrusion detection systems.
