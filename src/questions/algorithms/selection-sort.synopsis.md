Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm. Its purpose is to arrange elements in an array in a specific order (ascending or descending). It works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning of the sorted part. This process continues until the entire array is sorted. While easy to understand, its quadratic time complexity (O(n^2)) makes it inefficient for large datasets. It is primarily used for educational purposes or for very small datasets.
