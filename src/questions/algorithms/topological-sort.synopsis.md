Topological Sort is an algorithm for ordering the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Its purpose is to produce a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering. It works by repeatedly finding a vertex with no incoming edges, adding it to the sorted list, and removing it and its outgoing edges from the graph. This process continues until all vertices are processed. It is only possible for DAGs. Common use cases include scheduling tasks with dependencies (e.g., build systems, course prerequisites), resolving symbol dependencies in linkers, and data serialization.
