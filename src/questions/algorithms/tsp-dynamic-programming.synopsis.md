The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is an NP-hard optimization problem. Its purpose is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city. The dynamic programming approach (Held-Karp algorithm) solves TSP by building up solutions for subsets of cities and paths ending at a particular city. While it provides an exact solution, its exponential time complexity (O(n^2 * 2^n)) makes it feasible only for a small number of cities. Common use cases include logistics, circuit board drilling, and DNA sequencing.
