Z-Algorithm is a string-matching algorithm. Its purpose is to find all occurrences of a pattern string within a text string. It works by constructing a Z-array, where Z[i] stores the length of the longest substring starting at index i that is also a prefix of the string. By concatenating the pattern and text, the Z-array can be used to efficiently locate all occurrences of the pattern. Its key advantage is its linear time complexity (O(n+m), where n is text length and m is pattern length), making it highly efficient. Common use cases include string searching, pattern matching, and bioinformatics.
