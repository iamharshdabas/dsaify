An AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. Its purpose is to maintain a balanced tree structure to ensure that search, insertion, and deletion operations have a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. It works by ensuring that for every node, the height difference between its left and right subtrees (the balance factor) is no more than 1. If an insertion or deletion causes the tree to become unbalanced, it performs rotations to restore the balance. Its key advantage is its guaranteed logarithmic time complexity for all basic operations, unlike a regular binary search tree which can degrade to O(n) in the worst case. Common use cases include databases, file systems, and any application requiring efficient and reliable search, insert, and delete operations on ordered data.
