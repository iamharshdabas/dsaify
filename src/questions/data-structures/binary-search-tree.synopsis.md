A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure. Its purpose is to store data in a way that it can be retrieved efficiently. It works by organizing nodes such that for each node, all values in its left subtree are less than its own value, and all values in its right subtree are greater than its own value. This ordering allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations, with an average time complexity of O(log n). However, in the worst case (e.g., a skewed tree), these operations can degrade to O(n). Common use cases include implementing dictionaries, symbol tables, and for sorting algorithms.
