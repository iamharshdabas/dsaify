Disjoint Set Union (DSU), also known as Union-Find, is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint sets. Its purpose is to efficiently perform two operations: finding the representative (or root) of the set that an element belongs to, and uniting (merging) two sets into a single set. It works by representing each set as a tree, where each node points to its parent. Path compression and union by rank/size are optimizations that ensure nearly constant time complexity (amortized O(α(n)), where α is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows extremely slowly) for both operations. Common use cases include Kruskal's algorithm for MST, connected components in a graph, and network connectivity problems.
