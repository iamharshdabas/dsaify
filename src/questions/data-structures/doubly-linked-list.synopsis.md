A Doubly Linked List is a linear data structure similar to a singly linked list, but each node has two pointers: one pointing to the next node and another pointing to the previous node. This allows for traversal in both forward and backward directions. Doubly linked lists offer more flexibility for certain operations, such as efficient deletion of a given node, but at the cost of increased memory usage per node.
