A Doubly Linked List is a linear data structure. Its purpose is to store a sequence of elements where each element (node) contains a data field and two references (or pointers) â€“ one to the next node in the sequence and another to the previous node. This bidirectional linking allows for traversal in both forward and backward directions, and efficient insertion or deletion of nodes before or after a given node. Its key advantage over singly linked lists is the ability to traverse backwards and more efficient deletion of a given node (if its reference is known). Common use cases include implementing LRU caches, navigation in web browsers (back/forward buttons), and undo/redo functionalities in applications.
