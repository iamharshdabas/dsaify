A Fenwick Tree, also known as a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT), is a data structure that can efficiently update elements and calculate prefix sums in a table of numbers. Its purpose is to perform range sum queries and point updates in logarithmic time (O(log n)). It works by representing an array as a tree-like structure where each node stores the sum of a range of elements. The clever indexing allows for updates and queries to traverse only a logarithmic number of nodes. Its key advantages are its efficiency (better constant factors than segment trees for these specific operations) and smaller memory footprint. Common use cases include competitive programming problems involving range queries and updates, and in algorithms like counting inversions.
