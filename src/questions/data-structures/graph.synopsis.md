A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges. Edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. Graphs are used to represent networks, relationships, and connections between entities. The adjacency list representation is a common way to implement graphs, where each vertex has a list of its adjacent vertices. This representation is efficient for sparse graphs (graphs with fewer edges).
