A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections between nodes). Its purpose is to represent relationships between various entities. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted. They are highly versatile and can model a wide range of real-world problems. Common use cases include social networks, transportation networks, mapping applications, and representing dependencies in various systems.
