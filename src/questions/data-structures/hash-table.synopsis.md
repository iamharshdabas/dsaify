A Hash Table (or Hash Map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. It provides efficient average-case time complexity for insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations, typically O(1).
