A Hash Table (or Hash Map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, mapping keys to values. Its purpose is to provide efficient (average O(1)) lookup, insertion, and deletion of key-value pairs. It works by using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Collisions (when two keys hash to the same index) are handled using techniques like chaining or open addressing. Its key advantage is its average constant-time performance for basic operations. Common use cases include implementing dictionaries, caches, database indexing, and symbol tables in compilers.
