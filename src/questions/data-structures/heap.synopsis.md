A Heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: if P is a parent node of C, then the value of P is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the value of C. Its purpose is to efficiently retrieve the minimum or maximum element. It works by maintaining this property during insertions and deletions, typically using an array to represent the tree structure. Its key advantages include efficient (O(log n)) insertion and deletion of the min/max element, and O(1) access to the min/max element. Common use cases include implementing priority queues, heap sort algorithm, and in graph algorithms like Dijkstra's and Prim's.
