A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element (node) points to the next element in the sequence. It consists of nodes, each containing data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are dynamic in nature, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions of elements compared to arrays, but access to elements is sequential.
