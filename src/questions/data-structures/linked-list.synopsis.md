A Linked List is a linear data structure. Its purpose is to store a collection of elements (nodes) where each node contains a data field and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations, which allows for efficient insertions and deletions at any position once the position is found. However, random access to elements is not efficient (O(n)). Common use cases include implementing stacks and queues, managing dynamic memory, and representing polynomial equations.
