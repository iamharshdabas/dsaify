A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. Its purpose is to manage elements in a specific order, where the first element added is the first one to be removed. It works by supporting two primary operations: enqueue (adding an element to the rear) and dequeue (removing an element from the front). Its key characteristics are its strict ordering and efficient (O(1)) operations for adding and removing elements. Common use cases include managing tasks in operating systems, handling requests in web servers, breadth-first search (BFS) in graphs, and print spooling.
