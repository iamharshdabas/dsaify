A Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. Its purpose is to maintain a balanced tree structure to guarantee that search, insertion, and deletion operations have a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. It works by enforcing a set of properties (e.g., nodes are either red or black, root is black, no two adjacent red nodes) that ensure the longest path from the root to any leaf is no more than twice the length of the shortest path. This strict balancing makes it highly efficient for dynamic datasets. Common use cases include implementing associative arrays (like `std::map` in C++ or `TreeMap` in Java), database indexing, and in computational geometry algorithms.
