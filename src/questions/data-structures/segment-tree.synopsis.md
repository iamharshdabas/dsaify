A Segment Tree is a tree data structure used for storing information about intervals or segments. Its purpose is to allow for efficient querying (e.g., sum, minimum, maximum) over ranges and updating elements in an array. It works by recursively dividing the array into halves, with each node in the tree representing an interval. Queries and updates take logarithmic time (O(log n)). Its key advantage is its ability to handle range queries and point updates efficiently. Common use cases include competitive programming problems, database systems (for range queries), and in computational geometry.
