A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. Its purpose is to manage elements in a specific order, where the last element added is the first one to be removed. It works by supporting two primary operations: push (adding an element to the top) and pop (removing an element from the top). Its key characteristics are its strict ordering and efficient (O(1)) operations for adding and removing elements. Common use cases include function call management (call stack), undo/redo functionalities in applications, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms (e.g., DFS).
