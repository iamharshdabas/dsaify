A Binary Tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees are widely used for efficient searching and sorting, and they form the basis for more complex data structures like binary search trees and heaps. Common operations include insertion, deletion, and various traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
