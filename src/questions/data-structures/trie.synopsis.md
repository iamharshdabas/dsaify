A Trie (prefix tree) is a tree-like data structure. Its purpose is to store a dynamic set of strings or associative array where keys are strings. It works by storing characters at nodes, and paths from the root to a node represent a prefix. Nodes can also mark the end of a complete word. Its key advantages include efficient prefix-based searching, auto-completion, and spell-checking, with operations typically proportional to the length of the key (L) rather than the number of keys (N). Common use cases include dictionaries, auto-complete features in search bars, spell checkers, and IP routing.
