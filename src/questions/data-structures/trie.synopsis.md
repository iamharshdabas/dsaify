A Trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node. Tries are commonly used for efficient retrieval of keys, such as in autocomplete features, spell checkers, and IP routing.
